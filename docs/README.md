# Bay Area Traffic
We used publicly available data from [PeMS](http://pems.dot.ca.gov) to extract findings for traffic over time. We focused primarily on the Bay Area region. Helpful variables we looked at include flow _(number of vehicles that crossed over a highway sensor during a time frame)_, speed _(in mpg)_, longitude/latitude, and more. Our interest in bottlenecks _(defined as negative differentials in flow over time)_ motivated our project. Our insights include
1. Cluster analysis of bottlnecks
2. ![Delays on Highway 101 going into San Francisco, 2014-2018](https://github.com/laic5/traffic/blob/master/docs/_layouts/fiveyear.pdf)
3. Effects of intense rain and wind on traffic patterns
4. CHP incident patterns
